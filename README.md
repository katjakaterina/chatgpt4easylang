This repository contains the data used in the paper "ChatGPT as a CAT tool in Easy language translation" by Silvana Deilen, Sergio Hernández Garrido, Ekaterina Lapshinova-Koltunski and Christiane Maaß.

In the paper, we analyse the feasibility of using ChatGPT to translate citizen-oriented administrative texts into German Easy Language, a simplified, controlled language variety that is adapted to the needs of people with reading impairments.

The online tool ChatGPT is used to translate selected texts from websites of German public authorities. Two strategies are applied: (a) linguistic and (b) holistic. We analyse the quality of the generated texts based on different criteria, such as correctness, readability, and syntactic complexity. The results indicated that the generated texts are easier than the standard texts, but that they still do not fully meet the established Easy Language standards. Additionally, the content is not always rendered correctly.

The data used in the analysis can be found in the folder 'corpus' which contains both plain text (txt) and annotated (tokenised, lemmatised, UPOS-tagged and dependency parsed) data. We also include the script that was used to automatically annotate the data.
